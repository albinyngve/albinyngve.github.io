          <h1>Pop Culture's Effect on Society</h1>

        <p>A story well told, is said to have the potential force of shaping  minds, opinions and, ultimately, the ways people choose to lead their lives. This is why storytelling, fiction and works of popular culture throughout the history of mankind have played a important part in shaping not only individuals, but even societies and cultures. 
<br>
<br>
The most prominent example of works of fiction bleeding into, and shaping societies are the religious scriptures – both in terms of providing some sort of purpose and a moral and ethical compasses, but also in terms of being the reason for centuries, even millenniums, of war.
<br>
<br>
The fact that popular culture, in one way or another, impacts society and the people populating it is indisputable. The million dollar question is rather how, and/or in what ways its impacts manifests itself?
<br>
<br>
Every now and then, popular cultural phenomenons raise concerns and attracts criticism, more often than not, by older and conservative generations – worryingly accusing pop cultural phenomenon X as the reason for the always ongoing moral breakdown of the youth.
<br>
<br>
Music, for example, have always been a medium particularly sensitive to criticism. Pretty much every new and emerging genre or musical era have been accused of having a negative impact on their audience. From Elvis and Beatles of the ancient times, through the «satanistic» metal of the middle age, to the gangster-romanticising hip hop of modern time. 
<br>
<br>
The representation of violence in popular culture is also a never-ending topic. Moralists claim that high occurrences of violence in movies or video games correlates with the increasing numbers in crimes of violence. This is applicable to any specific phenomenon. The higher the exposure; the higher the hebetude relative to the phenomenon, they say. Furthermore, the representations in TV, movies, music and books also affects the structures, norms and ideals in society of its time. 
<br>
<br>
      With these perspectives in mind, I will, in a highly unscientificly correct manner, take a closer look at (crystal) meth-related statistics in relation to the years before, during and after the highly appraised TV-series Breaking Bad was aired.

       <h2>Case Study: Breaking Bad</h2>
            <p>Breaking Bad is a AMC-produced crime drama that premiered in january of 2008 – running for 5 seasons and 62 episodes before its' finale in september 2013. The show was a huge success, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. Breaking Bad received numerous awards, including sixteen Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards and a People's Choice Award.
<br><br>
It tells the story of Walter White, a struggling high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, who, together with his former student Jesse Pinkman, turns to a life of crime, producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies.
